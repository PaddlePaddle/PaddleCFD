# PaddleCFD 0.2.0 Release Notes

## Overview of PaddleCFD 0.2.0 Version
PaddleCFD is a deep learning toolkit based on the PaddlePaddle deep learning framework, focused on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) tasks. It's used for fluid mechanics equations discovery, numerical simulation acceleration, flow shape optimization, and flow control strategy discovery. The PaddleCFD 0.2.0 version mainly focuses on accelerating CFD numerical simulations, creating  surrogate models of fluid computation based on the PaddlePaddle framework. It has achieved breakthroughs in model accuracy and computational efficiency, providing high baseline models for researchers in the field of fluid mechanics and turnkey tool libraries for enterprise users. The main features of the PaddleCFD 0.2.0 version are as follows:
- **Coverage of Mainstream Cutting-edge Surrogate Models**: The PaddleCFD 0.2.0 version includes specific scientific computing models like the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) and DeepONet, as well as cutting-edge deep learning models such as Transformer, Diffusion models, and KAN. These models possess strong operator learning, prediction, and generation capabilities, and are at the forefront of research in the AI+ fluid mechanics field (data source: Clarivate Analytics Essential Science Indicators).
- **Leading Precision/Computational Efficiency**: The PaddleCFD 0.2.0 version has improved and adapted models from publicly available versions in papers, achieving dual enhancements in model accuracy and computational efficiency. The ppfno model, through integral learning, has an average relative error of less than 3.5% in drag coefficient predictions in the test dataset (baseline model ~8%). Through operator fusion, training speed has increased by 75%, and inference speed has tripled, achieving second-level inference for tens of millions of grids. The pptransfomer model, through PaddlePaddle's dynamic-to-static conversion and Compiler Infrastructure for Neural Networks (CINN), has improved training speed by 29.4%, with dual-GPU parallel efficiency reaching 90.2%, supporting parallel inference for tens of millions of grids. The ppkan model, compared to traditional MLP neural networks, has a 30% accuracy improvement with a similar number of parameters. The ppdifusion model, through data parallelism, achieves scalable acceleration of the model, with single-machine multi-GPU parallel efficiency reaching over 99.4%. The ppdeeponet model, based on the MultiONet network structure and through the second-order optimizer SOAP, achieves approximately a 10% improvement in model accuracy.
- **Full Scenario Support for Industrial Implementation**: The PaddleCFD 0.2.0 version pays more attention to the industrial implementation, polishing and enhancing model accuracy and computational efficiency through real industrial business scenarios, and perfecting model function modules. For example, for the ppfno model's task of predicting aerodynamic drag coefficients, a complete set of functional modules has been developed, including training/inference data (volumetric & surface grid) preprocessing, distributed training, offline inference, online inference, etc., enabling containerized deployment of model training and inference, with applications in leading enterprises in the high-speed train industry. Additionally, the PaddleCFD 0.2.0 version offers data parsing modules for various CFD data formats, enabling seamless integration with multiple traditional CFD simulation software.
- **Single Folder Strategy to Enhance Usability**: Drawing from the successful suite strategy of HuggingFace in the AI field, the PaddleCFD 0.2.0 version places all modules involved in the model into the same folder. This avoids excessive encapsulation of deep learning framework APIs, reducing the learning curve and maintenance costs for users.
