## About PaddleCFD

PaddleCFD is a deep learning toolkit for surrogate modeling, equation discovery, shape optimization and flow-control strategy discovery in the field of fluid mechanics. Currently, it mainly supports surrogate modeling, including models based on fourier neural operator (FNO), diffusion model, transformer, physics-informed model and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN).

## Code structure

- `config`: config files for different tasks
- `doc`: documentation
- `examples`: example scripts
- `ppcfd/data`: data-process source code
